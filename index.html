                    <p>One thing I really enjoy doing is applying servant leadership, project management, and web development skills into my daily work; that is exactly what I got to do in this project! At Kyndryl, there was a high-profile initiative to replace the deeply ingrained IBM UI framework, named Carbon, with a new in-house developed UI framework, Shidoka. This would change the way our frontends looked and help establish Kyndryl's distinct visual identity after its separation from IBM.</p>

                    <h5>Overview</h5>
                    <p>After being asked by the Director to manage this project, I jumped at the chance. I would need to collaborate with eight different developer teams spread across time zones and cultures. I also had to understand and troubleshoot issues in frameworks I was not experienced with (looking at you, Angular and Svelte).</p>

                    <h5>Challenges</h5>
                    <p>Carbon had been extensively used across all frontends before the codebases were ported over to Kyndryl. In other words, Carbon was not just deeply integrated into our Vue, React, Angular, and Lit frameworks, but also an integral part of our frontend devs' workflow and knowledge base. And there was a tight deadline of one month.</p>

                    <h5>Execution</h5>
                    <p>While I love working with technology, I also enjoy activities that cultivate my communication skills and empathy. This project required both: making the switch to Shidoka as smooth as possible meant building rapport with the dev teams and getting their voluntary buy-in as much as was up to me. The general steps included the following:</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Planning:</strong> I collaborated closely with product managers and senior architects to devise a comprehensive rollout plan.</li>
                      <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> To prepare for implementation across all teams and frontend frameworks and identify potential challenges, I first implemented Shidoka in the React frontend for which I was the lead developer.</li>
                      <li><strong>Communication:</strong> To kick the project off and continuously throughout, I posted division-wide communication that was supportive and offered technical assistance, prioritized remaining tasks, and tracked overall progress compared to deadlines. I also began reaching out individually to all the development teams to introduce myself and offer assistance.</li>
                      <li><strong>Support:</strong> Providing daily engagement and support was where I really got my hands dirty. I spent time with the individual frontend teams to address technical difficulties and find solutions to the issues they were facing.  </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>Reflection</h5>
                    <p>The hardest part of this project was working very early in the morning to assist the India team. There was also an outdated and bloated Angular app that gave me (and the Angular team) a lot of technical problems. In the end, however, this project was successful and I got to use all the skills that I enjoy the most: servant leadership, project management, and web development. The best part of this work was getting to know people from teams I wouldn't have otherwise interacted with much.</p>
